  <h2>CSS Themes</h2>
  <p>Styling and theming in eang is fully customizable and can be easily changed. New and upcoming features of CSS
    alleviate
    a lot of the maintainability problems of CSS. Eang relies heavily on CSS Custom Properties and nesting and uses a
    PostCSS
    pipeline to support older browsers.
  </p>


  <p>Unlike other component frameworks, the style is not set in stone and does not abstract or encapsulates away the
    power of
    CSS. Instead it embraces new capabilities of CSS and puts design back into the hand of the designer.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="ea-card">
      <div class="ea-card-header">
        <h3>Theme examples</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="ea-card-content example" grid style="justify-items: center; padding: 3rem 0;">
        <div class="mode">
          <h3>Mode Theme</h3>
          <small>Select the airport you are flying from.</small>
          <!-- <label>Airport Lookup</label> -->
          <ea-autocomplete #from [suggestions]="airportResult1$" [formControl]="airportSearchTerm1" [mapSelectItem]="mapSelectItem"
            placeholder="from*" [selectFirst]="true">
            <ng-template #resultsTemplate let-item>
              <span class="matched" [innerHTML]="item.match"></span>
            </ng-template>
          </ea-autocomplete>
        </div>
        <div class="material">
          <h3>Material Theme</h3>

          <small>Select the airport you are flying to.</small>
          <!-- <label>Airport lookup</label> -->
          <ea-autocomplete [suggestions]="airportResult2$" [formControl]="airportSearchTerm2" [mapSelectItem]="mapSelectItem"
            placeholder="to*">
            <ng-template #resultsTemplate let-item>
              <span class="matched" [innerHTML]="item.match"></span>
            </ng-template>
          </ea-autocomplete>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Eang has multiple build-in themes. Each theme can be extensively customized with CSS Custom Properties. Each theme
    has
    global variables as well as component based CSS variables.</p>

  <ea-markdown [doc]="variables"></ea-markdown>

  <p>These properties can also just apply within a specific scope of your page.</p>

  <ea-markdown [doc]="scope"></ea-markdown>

  <p>If overriding variables and properties for some reason does not work in your case, there is nothing prevents you
    from creating
    your own theme.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that is not enough, eang allows you to define the CSS of each component individually additional themes can be be
    added.
    This allows users of eang to fully customize the the look and feel of each component and makes it easy to comply
    with
    Corporate Design guidelines.
