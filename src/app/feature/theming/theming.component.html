  <h2>CSS Themes</h2>
  <p>
    Styling and theming in eang is fully customizable and can be easily changed.
    New and upcoming features of CSS alleviate a lot of the maintainability
    problems of CSS. Eang relies heavily on CSS Custom Properties and nesting
    and uses a PostCSS pipeline to support older browsers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike other component frameworks, the style is not set in stone and does
    not abstract or encapsulates away the power of CSS. Instead it embraces new
    capabilities of CSS and puts design back into the hand of the designer.

  <p>
    Eang has multiple build-in themes. Each theme can be extensively customized
    with CSS Custom Properties. Each theme has global variables as well as
    component based CSS variables.
  </p>

  <ea-markdown  class="example" [doc]="variables"></ea-markdown>

  <p>
    These properties can also just apply within a specific scope of your page.
  </p>

  <ea-markdown  class="example" [doc]="scope"></ea-markdown>

  <p>
    These are all variables that you can override in <code>:root</code> or for a specific theme.
    For example default values for <code>mode</code> theme.
  </p>

  <ea-markdown  class="example" [doc]="allVariablesForOverride"></ea-markdown>

  <p>
    If overriding variables and properties for some reason does not work in your
    case, there is nothing prevents you from creating your own theme.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that is not enough, eang allows you to define the CSS of each component
    individually additional themes can be be added. This allows users of eang to
    fully customize the the look and feel of each component and makes it easy to
    comply with Corporate Design guidelines.
